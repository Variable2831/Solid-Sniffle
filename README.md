This machine learning project with Python is a personal endeavor to explore the potential of ML and create open-source solutions that can be shared with the wider community.

If you're interested in learning more about machine learning, you're welcome to explore the codebase and documentation. While this project is currently maintained by a single contributor, we hope to inspire others to join and contribute to this.

Let's work together to create innovative and accessible ML solutions that make a positive impact. With Python and open-source software, we can unlock the potential of machine learning and create a better future.

Please note that this project is still a work in progress. I am actively working on it and plan to add more features soon. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.üëç

## Usage

This repository provides a variety of Python functions and utilities that you can use in your own projects. 

- `battle`: This code generates a battle code in which a list of people are randomly assigned numbers for food, water, and shelter. The person with the highest number in any category wins. The winner is then written to a text file and their probability of winning again is determined. The scores of all participants are then updated and written to a text file, and the final scores are printed.

You can find the complete list of scripts and utilities in the `src` directory.
